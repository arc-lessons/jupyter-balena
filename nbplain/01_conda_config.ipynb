Conda allows us to specify specific versions of all the libraries we will need, even the Python version, and these can get large very quickly.  Therefore we will use our `scratch` storage for our conda environments.  While this storage is not backed up we will see later how we can create files which can be used to recreate our environment.  This allows us to recreate our environment is required and share reproducible workflows by recording the specific version of libraries we used for our computation.\n",
